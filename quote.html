    <p>"The world of being is unchangeable, rigid, exact, delightful to the mathematician, the logician,
    the builder of metaphysical systems, and all those who love perfection more than life. </p><p>
    The world of existence is fleeting, vague, without sharp boundaries, withount any clear plan or arrangement,
    but it contains all thoughts and feelings, all the data of sense, and all physical objects, everything that
  can either do good or harm, everything that makes any difference to the value of life or the world. </p><p>
  According to our temperaments, we shall prefer the contemplation of the one or of the other. The one we do not prefer will
  probably seem to us a pale shadow of the one we prefer, and hardly worth to be regarded as in any sense real.
  But the truth is that both have the same claim on our impartial attention, both are real, and both are important to the metaphysician" - Bertrand Russell</p>
